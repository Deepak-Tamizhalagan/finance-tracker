# Personal Finance Tracker – DevOps CI/CD Project

The Personal Finance Tracker is a simple full-stack web application that helps users record daily expenses and visualize their spending.

This project showcases a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline designed to build, test, and deploy a fully functional web application along with its cloud infrastructure. We developed a simple full-stack app with a frontend, backend APIs, and a database, then automated the entire workflow using modern DevOps tools such as Git, GitHub, IaC (Terraform), and a CI/CD orchestration tool.

The project demonstrates real-world practices like branching strategy, pull requests, automated testing, code scanning, and cloud deployment. It also includes logging, monitoring, and documentation to ensure reliability and visibility.

## Task 1 — Application Development (Backend, Frontend, Database)

This task focuses on building the core application that will later be deployed through our CI/CD pipeline. We developed a simple Personal Finance Tracker where users can add, view, and delete expenses, while also viewing a real-time summary and spending breakdown. The backend uses FastAPI with SQLite for data storage, and the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📌 1. What We Built

We created a working full-stack mini-application that acts as the foundation for our CI/CD pipeline. It includes a clean frontend UI, a FastAPI backend service with multiple REST endpoints, and an SQLite database to persist expense records. The app is small and simple but fully functional, making it ideal for demonstrating automation.

📌 2. Backend API Overview

The backend exposes essential REST APIs for adding, retrieving, summarizing, and deleting expenses. All operations connect directly to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy ORM. A basic health check endpoint is also included for CI/CD and monitoring.

📌 3. Frontend Overview

The frontend provides an easy-to-use layout with an “Add Expense” form, a scrollable expense list, a spending summary, and a dynamic pie chart visualizing category-wise spending. It interacts with the backend using JavaScript Fetch API.

📌 4. How to Run the Application Locally

Follow these steps to run both backend and frontend.

▶️ Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Deepak-Tamizhalagan/finance-tracker.git
cd finance-tracker
```

▶️ Step 2: Create & Activate Virtual Environment
```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

▶️ Step 3: Install Backend Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

▶️ Step 4: Start the FastAPI Server
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

If successful, you will see:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

▶️ Step 5: Open the Frontend

Navigate to:
```
finance-tracker/frontend/index.html
```

Right-click → Open with Live Server

📌 5. Expected Behavior

Once both backend & frontend are running:

✔️ Add an expense → Instantly stored in database

✔️ Expense list updates without reload

✔️ Summary updates live

✔️ Chart updates dynamically

✔️ Delete button removes item instantly
