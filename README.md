# Personal Finance Tracker – DevOps Capstone Project

This project is a simple full-stack Personal Finance Tracker that allows users to record and view their daily expenses. Our goal is to implement the complete DevOps lifecycle: application development, containerization, IaC, CI/CD automation, cloud deployment, and monitoring.

## What We Are Building
- Lightweight backend API (FastAPI/Node.js)
- Minimal frontend UI
- Database for storing expenses
- Dockerized services with optional Kubernetes flavor
- Terraform-based AWS infrastructure
- Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Monitoring via AWS CloudWatch

## Collaboration
Two-member team using:
- Feature branching
- Pull requests
- Code reviews
